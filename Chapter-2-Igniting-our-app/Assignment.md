### ❓ What is NPM?
**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is the tool that helps developers manage JavaScript packages or libraries. When you install Node.js, you automatically get NPM. It allows you to download, install, and manage dependencies for your project. Think of it as a centralized hub for reusable code.

---

### ❓ What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
**Parcel and Webpack** are **bundlers**. They take all your project's files—JavaScript, CSS, images—and package them into a single optimized file (or set of files) that the browser can understand. We need them to:
- Simplify our codebase
- Optimize performance (minification, tree shaking, etc.)
- Support development features like Hot Module Replacement

---

### ❓ What is `.parcel-cache`?
`.parcel-cache` is a directory created by Parcel to **store intermediate build information**. It speeds up your development by avoiding repetitive processing during each build. So the next time you run it, Parcel uses this cache to skip unnecessary work.

---

### ❓ What is `npx`?
`npx` lets you **run packages without installing them globally**. It's a handy tool when you just want to execute a command (like `npx parcel`) without permanently adding it to your system.

---

### ❓ What's the difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`?
- **Dependencies**: Required to run the actual application (e.g. React).
- **DevDependencies**: Only needed during development (e.g. Parcel, Jest).

Example:
```bash
npm install react      # adds to dependencies
npm install -D parcel  # adds to devDependencies
````

---

### ❓ What is Tree Shaking?

**Tree shaking** is a technique used to eliminate **dead or unused code**. It's like trimming branches off a tree—you only keep the code that you actually use, which helps reduce file size and improve performance.

---

### ❓ What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR)?

HMR allows you to **update your code in real-time** without refreshing the entire page. It's especially useful during development because it preserves app state while you tweak your code.

---

### ❓ List 5 Superpowers of Parcel and explain any 3:

1. HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
2. Tree Shaking
3. File Watching
4. Minification
5. Zero Configuration

**Explained:**

* **HMR**: Speeds up development by updating modules without refreshing the browser.
* **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code to reduce bundle size.
* **Zero Config**: Just install and run—no config files or setup required.

---

### ❓ What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add to it?

A `.gitignore` file tells Git which files/folders **not to track**. You should add:

* `node_modules/`
* `.parcel-cache/`
* `dist/`
* `.env` (secrets)

You should **not add**:

* `package-lock.json` (helps ensure consistent installs across environments)

---

### ❓ What's the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?

* **`package.json`**: Lists the packages you want and basic project metadata.
* **`package-lock.json`**: Locks the **exact versions** of installed packages to ensure consistent builds across teams/machines.

---

### ❓ Why shouldn't I modify `package-lock.json`?

It's auto-generated by NPM to **lock dependency versions**. Editing it manually can lead to version mismatches and unstable builds.

---

### ❓ What is `node_modules`? Should I push it to Git?

`node_modules` is where all your installed packages live. It's often **very large** and should **never be pushed** to Git. Instead, share your `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, and others can run `npm install` to recreate it.

---

### ❓ What is the `dist` folder?

The `/dist` folder contains **production-ready code**. After bundling and minifying your files, this is what gets deployed. It usually includes:

* Compressed JavaScript/CSS
* HTML
* Static assets

---

### ❓ What is `browserslist`?

Browserslist is a config tool that tells build tools (like Babel, Autoprefixer) which browsers you want to **support**. This helps your app work in older or specific browser versions.

Example:

```json
"browserslist": [
  ">0.2%",
  "not dead",
  "not op_mini all"
]
```

### ❓ What are the differences among Parcel, Vite, and Webpack?

| Feature      | Parcel            | Vite                             | Webpack                 |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Config       | Zero-config       | Minimal config                   | Often needs config      |
| Speed        | Fast, caching     | Extremely fast (uses ES modules) | Slower unless optimized |
| Build Output | Optimized bundles | Optimized bundles                | Optimized bundles       |
| Dev Server   | Yes (with HMR)    | Yes (with HMR)                   | Yes (with HMR)          |
| Best For     | Simplicity        | Speed + DX                       | Custom setups           |

---

### ❓ What do `^` (caret) and `~` (tilde) mean in `package.json`?

* `^1.2.3`: Allows updates to minor and patch versions (e.g. 1.3.0, but not 2.0.0)
* `~1.2.3`: Allows only patch updates (e.g. 1.2.4, but not 1.3.0)
  This helps control dependency updates and avoid breaking changes.

---

### ❓ What are script types in HTML?

From MDN Docs:

* `<script>`: Default, runs immediately when encountered.
* `type="module"`: Supports ES Modules (`import`/`export`), deferred by default.
* `type="text/javascript"`: Legacy, treated same as default now.

Other attributes:

* `async`: Loads script asynchronously and runs as soon as it's loaded.
* `defer`: Loads script asynchronously but waits to execute until HTML is fully parsed.
